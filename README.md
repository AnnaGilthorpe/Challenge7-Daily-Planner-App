# Challenge7-Daily-Planner-App
Description

The aim of this challenge was to create a daily planner for a busy employee.

This app is built using JQuery. It displays the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner, presents timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down, color-codes each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed, allows a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock, saves the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock and persists events between refreshes of a page. It also uses a timer to keep uspdating the page/

This challenge helped me learn about and how to use JQuery code.

The finer details of what I have learnt include:-
<ul>
 <li> Using moment to time and date connection, manipulating and formatting</li>
  <li>Creating and using functions </li>
  <li> Creating an each loop </li>
  <li> Creating if and else if statements </li>
  <li> Using parseInt to manage data </li>
  <li> Adding a timer</li>
  <li> Creating code to use local storage </li>
  <li> Adding and removing classes </li>
  <li> Using onclick events </li>
  <li> Creating a user friendly interface <li/>

Technologies used:- MAC Terminal, VS Code and Git Hub.
